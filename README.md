# AWS Cloud Server

* Lab-16 Descripton:
   * Deploy a simple Node.js server to EC2, using Elastic Beanstalk
* Lab-17 Description:
   * AWS Lambda allows writing code that is triggered in the cloud, without thinking about maintaining servers. 
   * We’ll use it today to automatically run some processing on image files after they’re uploaded to an S3 Bucket.
